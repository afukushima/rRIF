Description: An R implementation of the Regulatory Impact Factors (RIF) 
    presented by Hudson et al. (2009) and Reverter et al. (2010). RIF aims 
    to identify critical transcription factor (TF) between two conditions 
    from gene expression data. The concept is based on integration of three 
    statistical information from typical transcriptome data: (1) the 
    co-expression change between the TF and the differentially expressed genes
    (DEGs); (2) the amount of differential expression (i.e, foldchange) of 
    DEGs; and (3) the abundance of DEGs. The package can calculate both RIF1 
    and RIF2 and simplified/expand the original HudsonRIF's code by Kevin 
    Rue-Albrecht.
